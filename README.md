Scaling-of-Earthquake-Source 

This small MATLAB package implements the empirical earthquake source-scaling relations to enable Monte Carlo approach 
in predicting the source parameter(s), i.e., magnitude, and source dimensions (rupture length, rupture width, rupture area) 
when either of them is provided.
